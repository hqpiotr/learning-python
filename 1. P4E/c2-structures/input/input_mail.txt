Hi,

It is true that NIDD is the same, but still there are some configuratiom differences between BTS configured as ProductVariantPlanned = x and y. 
And it seems it is still worth to check on both x and y Classical mode if proper full config is exchanged between a and b, c and d and in opposite way back, with validation of parameters. 

Best Regards
